# AA-Partner Deploy Dev job guard (ported from AA-Booking, AA-751 B4), run by the `preflight` job of .github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml.
# Tested by api/tests/unit/test_deploy_preflight_script.py with stub `aws` and `curl` on PATH.
#
# Exit 0 = the deploy may go on; exit 1 = blocked. Every path that cannot prove "nothing can be interrupted"
# blocks (fail closed), unless OVERRIDE carries a non-blank reason (workflow_dispatch input, Nghiệp only): then a
# ::warning:: names the reason and the deploy goes on.
#
# Environment:
#   ECS_CLUSTER, ECS_SERVICE   the AA-Partner API service (AWS credentials already configured)
#   BASE_URL                   AA-Partner API base URL; the gate is <BASE_URL>/crm/ci/deploy-gate

#   GATE_AUDIENCE              OIDC audience, default aa-crm-deploy-gate (app/auth/ci.py DEPLOY_GATE_AUDIENCE)
#   ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL / _TOKEN   set by the runner when the job has `id-token: write`
