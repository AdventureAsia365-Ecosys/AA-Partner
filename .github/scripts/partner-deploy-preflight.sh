# AA-Partner Deploy Dev job guard (ported from AA-Booking, AA-751 B4), run by the `preflight` job of .github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml.
# Tested by api/tests/unit/test_deploy_preflight_script.py with stub `aws` and `curl` on PATH.
#
# Exit 0 = the deploy may go on; exit 1 = blocked. Since AA-993 G5 (design D1.4) the gate's safe_to_deploy is
# false only while a deploy-blocking kind (DEPLOY_BLOCKING_KINDS; none since AA-993 G4b, crm_dispatch left it) is
# RUNNING, or QUEUED and due within 15 min (this runs before the build: the old task would claim it before its
# SIGTERM); other queued/running jobs are released on shutdown and re-claimed by the new task. Every path that cannot read the gate blocks (fail closed), unless OVERRIDE carries a
# non-blank reason (workflow_dispatch input, Nghiệp only): then a ::warning:: names the reason and the deploy goes on.

# Environment:
#   ECS_CLUSTER, ECS_SERVICE   the AA-Partner API service (AWS credentials already configured)
