"""The ``crm.job`` worker loop (crm-001; ADR 0003a). Ported from AA-Booking ``app/jobs/worker.py`` (bk-002, AA-751).

One asyncio task, one job at a time, inside the API process (started from the app lifespan when ``WORKER_ENABLED`` is
on), never from a request path. Several processes may run it at once (a rolling deploy overlaps two tasks): claims
use ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` and every handler is idempotent.

Each tick: every ``maintenance_every`` ticks reap expired leases (a stopped worker's job is re-claimed: card CRM-05 E
check), schedule the recurring kinds and prune their history, and call the maintenance hooks; then claim one due job
and run its handler under a heartbeat. A handler returns a result dict (ids and counts only, checked by
:func:`app.jobs.payload_guard.check_payload`) or raises — :class:`PermanentError` fails the job at once, anything else
is retried with backoff until ``max_attempts``.

Recurring kinds have no singleton index in crm.job (crm-001 is the plain template). The scheduler instead gives each
run an idempotency key per time slot, ``<kind>:<slot>`` with ``slot = floor(epoch / every_seconds)``: two workers in
the same slot insert one row (``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``), and the key of a finished slot is never reused.

Errors: the job row keeps the exception **class** only (crm-001: "error class and ids only, never personal data or a
message echoing input"); the message goes to the log line (scrubbed, ``app.observability``) and to Sentry.

Shutdown: the lifespan sets ``stop`` and gives the loop ``WORKER_STOP_TIMEOUT_S``; a job still running then is
cancelled and **released** back to the queue at once (:func:`app.jobs.queue.release`), instead of staying ``running``
until its lease expires. A kind in ``no_release`` is failed at once instead.
