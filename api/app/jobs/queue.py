"""SQL operations on ``crm.job`` (crm-001, ADR 0003a template). Ported from AA-Booking ``app/jobs/queue.py``.

Same semantics as CIS ``shared/jobs/queue.py`` (ADR 0003): every state change is one UPDATE guarded by the expected
status and, for a running job, by ``locked_by`` — so a worker that lost its lease can never overwrite what the reaper
or another worker already did. Kinds are ``crm_*`` (CHECK ``job_kind_chk`` in crm-001).

A job with ``cancel_requested`` is never claimed, and the reaper, :func:`release` and a retryable :func:`fail` end it as
``cancelled`` instead of putting it back in the queue. Each claim records ``progress.attempt_started_at`` (the first
attempt's ``started_at`` is kept), and a graceful shutdown releases a running job at once (:func:`release`) instead of
leaving it to the lease expiry.

Personal data never enters a job row (DM-6.3; crm-001 column comments): :func:`enqueue` checks the payload with
:func:`app.jobs.payload_guard.check_payload` (ids only), and the worker stores an error's class name, never its message.
