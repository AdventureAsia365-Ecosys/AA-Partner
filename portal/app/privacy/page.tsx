      <LegalSection id="collect" title="2. What we collect">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Partner account.</strong> Your business name, plan and account status, and the API key you sign in
            with. We check the key on our server; the browser then holds a sign-in session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Brand settings and content.</strong> The brand voice and settings you enter, the tour rewrites and
            social or blog pieces generated for you, and your edits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Channel connections.</strong> The details you give us to publish to your own channels (for example a
            WordPress site or a Facebook Page).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Activity records.</strong> Each AI model call (provider, model, cost, time, partner and job), each
            publish and unpublish (piece, channel, post id, status, time, and whether your account or an Adventure Asia
            admin acted), and an admin log of changes to partner accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical data.</strong> IP address, browser type and request logs, processed by our hosting providers
            and our security systems.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="cookies" title="3. Cookies">
        <p>
          The portal uses only sign-in cookies, which scripts on the page cannot read. They hold your session and expire
          after 24 hours or when you sign out. We do not use advertising or analytics cookies.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="use" title="4. How we use your data">
        <ul>
          <li>To run your account and produce the content you ask for.</li>
          <li>To publish or unpublish a piece on your channels when you tell us to.</li>
          <li>To support you, keep the service secure, and enforce the partner terms.</li>
          <li>To measure our own costs and service quality.</li>

      <LegalSection id="ai" title="5. AI processing">
        <p>
          Content is generated and checked by AI models. Claude (Anthropic), through Amazon Bedrock, writes it; OpenAI
          models, also through Amazon Bedrock, review, score and check the drafts. If Amazon Bedrock is unavailable,
          the Anthropic API or the OpenAI API, used directly and with a spending cap, may be used as a fallback; those
          calls go from Amazon Web Services to Anthropic or OpenAI. For some partners, a decision-checking service (Jev,
          by TypeSafe) also answers yes-or-no checks about the drafts. These providers receive tour content,
          your brand settings and the instructions for each piece. Our policy is not to send personal data to these
          models and not to store any in our AI call records, so please do not enter personal data about other people
          in brand settings or content.
