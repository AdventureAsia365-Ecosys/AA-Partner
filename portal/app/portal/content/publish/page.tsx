// portal/app/portal/content/publish/page.tsx — AA-457 [T11 PR1] + AA-458 [T11 PR2] + AA-815
// AA-759: was /portal/t11-publish (308 from the old slug, next.config.ts).
//
// AA-457 built the connect flow (Option 3+2, AA-456 STEP0 §9): a channel that isn't connected yet
// shows its connect form inline here. AA-458 added the "Ready to Publish" list (PublishPendingList),
// which stays visible even when nothing is connected (its Publish buttons disable with "Connect
// <channel> to publish") so a tenant always sees what they have ready.
//
// AA-815: two channels — WordPress (blog) and a Facebook Page — each with its own connect form /
// status card, the pending list gated per channel, and a "Published" list with Unpublish
// (PublishedList). An Unpublish puts the piece back in Ready to Publish (reloadSignal).
// AA-761: a connected channel shows a one-line summary (health of the last test + "Manage"); the status card with
// "Test connection", "Change credentials" and Disconnect lives on Account › Integrations.
